The main limitation of the Andrade (2010) study was the way that participants doodled. Participants were given 
sheets of paper with objects to shade in (squares and circles) while they listened to the audio recording. By about 6000 BCE, 
a Neolithic culture took root in the Nile Valley. The Giza pyramid complex (also called the Giza necropolis) in Egypt is home to the Great Pyramid.
To ensure that the pyramid remained symmetrical, the exterior casing stones all had to be equal in height and width.
