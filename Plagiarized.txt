An additional limitation of Andrade’s (2010) study, which the author mentioned is the article, is that there were
no measures of daydreaming that could confirm the hypothesis that students who doodled engaged in
daydreaming less than students who listened and took notes. The present study was designed to address
some of the limitations of the existing work on doodling. First, we focused on whether different types of doodling
would yield the same effect on recall ability. Our second question centered on a more practical issue: How does
doodling compare to other proven tools such as note-taking? In Andrade’s study, participants in the “control”
group took notes but only on part of the information on which they were to be assessed. Finally, we sought to
compare different types of doodling to note-taking.
